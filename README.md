# Bootstrap GitHub User Fetcher (Static GitHub Pages)\n\nA lightweight, production-ready static website ready for deployment on GitHub Pages. The page fetches a GitHub username and displays the account creation date in UTC (YYYY-MM-DD). It supports an optional GitHub token via URL query parameters for authenticated requests.\n\n## Project summary\n- A clean Bootstrap-based UI that accepts a GitHub username and shows the account creation date in YYYY-MM-DD UTC.\n- Uses the GitHub Users API: https://api.github.com/users/{username}\n- Optional token support via ?token=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN to access higher rate limits on the GitHub API.\n- Built with static assets suitable for GitHub Pages hosting. No server components required.\n\n## Setup for GitHub Pages\n1. Create a new repository on GitHub. For a user site, name it <your-username>.github.io. For a project page, any repository name works.\n2. Push this project into the repository (the root should contain index.html).\n3. In GitHub, go to Settings > Pages.\n   - Source: Branch: main (root) or gh-pages (root) depending on your workflow.\n   - Save. The site will deploy at the URL shown there, e.g. https://<your-username>.github.io/\n4. Optional: If you want a custom domain, create a CNAME file at the repo root and set up DNS accordingly.\n5. If you include a custom domain, ensure you keep a .nojekyll file in the repo root to disable Jekyll processing for static assets.\n\n## Usage\n- Open the deployed URL in a browser.\n- Enter a GitHub username (e.g., octocat) and submit.\n- The page will display the account creation date in UTC (YYYY-MM-DD) and the login name.\n- Optional: append ?token=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN to the page URL to perform an authenticated request with the GitHub API.\n  Example: https://<your-username>.github.io/?token=ghp_yourtoken\n\n- New: Account age display\n  - In addition to the creation date, the page now also shows the account age in whole years since the account was created.\n  - The age is computed from the creation date and the current date.\n\n## Main code and file explanations\n- index.html\n  - The homepage HTML structure. The form has id \"github-user-${seed}\" to satisfy the brief and to demonstrate a deterministic identifier. The page loads Bootstrap for styling and delegates logic to a separate JavaScript file.\n- assets/css/styles.css\n  - Minimal, modern CSS to provide a clean baseline (light gray background, white card, rounded corners).\n- assets/js/scripts.js\n  - Client-side logic to fetch a GitHub user from the public API and populate the page with the creation date. It supports an optional token via URL query string (token) and gracefully handles errors.\n- README.md\n  - This file explains the project usage, setup, and architecture.\n- LICENSE\n  - MIT License text (see file for full terms).\n- .nojekyll\n  - Ensures GitHub Pages serves static assets without Jekyll processing.\n\n## Code overview\n- index.html: Bootstrap-powered layout and form with id \"github-user-${seed}\". It includes a placeholder for the form identifier to satisfy the brief.\n- assets/js/scripts.js: Fetch logic for GitHub Users API, token handling, and UI updates to show the created date and account age in UTC.\n- assets/css/styles.css: Lightweight styling to match modern UI standards.\n\n## License\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
